## [Unreleased]

### Fixed
- **`dtctl get dashboard <id> -o yaml` (and `-o json`) now render the document body again instead of a list of raw byte values** — the SDK extraction in 0.28.0 ([#239](https://github.com/dynatrace-oss/dtctl/pull/239)) split the document model into an SDK type and a CLI read-model type, but the CLI type only carried `UnmarshalJSON` — its `MarshalJSON`/`MarshalYAML` were not ported. Since `get dashboard`/`notebook`/`launchpad` print the CLI type, YAML output fell back to default struct marshaling and serialized the `Content []byte` field element-by-element as integers (`content:` → `- 123` → `- 34` …), while JSON output silently dropped `content` entirely (the field is tagged `json:"-"`); the previously-emitted `modificationInfo` timestamps were lost the same way. The CLI `Document` now delegates both marshalers to the SDK type, restoring structured `content` and `modificationInfo` in `json`/`yaml`/`toon` output (table/csv/wide were unaffected). Regression coverage added at three layers that the bug fell between: unit tests on the CLI type's marshalers, an integration test over the full `handler.Get` → render path, and a single-document golden fixture with a populated `Content` (the existing document golden fixtures all had empty content, which is why the gap went unnoticed); affects 0.28.0–0.30.0
- **`dtctl get analyzer <name> -o yaml`, `dtctl exec analyzer -o yaml`, and `dtctl history ... -o yaml` no longer emit byte-value lists or leak table-only fields** — an audit for the same bug class found that the analyzer CLI types (`Analyzer`, `AnalyzerDefinition`, `ExecuteResult`) and the document `Snapshot` type had no `MarshalYAML` and relied on JSON struct tags that YAML reflection ignores. For `AnalyzerDefinition` this meant the `input`/`output`/`analyzerCall` schemas (stored as `json.RawMessage`, i.e. `[]byte`) rendered as lists of raw byte values in YAML — the same severe failure mode as the dashboard bug; across all four types YAML also lowercased keys (`displayname`), ignored `omitempty`, and surfaced display-only `json:"-"` fields (`categoryName`, `resultID`/`status`/`executionStatus`, snapshot `createdBy`/`createdTime`) that JSON correctly hides. These types now implement `MarshalYAML` via a new shared `format.YAMLNodeFromJSON` helper, so YAML output is structurally identical to JSON. (`anomalydetector` and `extension`, which carry the same risk, already guarded it with custom marshalers and were unaffected.) Covered by unit tests asserting YAML/JSON parity plus single-object golden fixtures for the analyzer definition and snapshot; affects 0.28.0–0.30.0

## [0.30.0] - 2026-06-12

### Added
- **`--jq` filter for structured output** — a global `--jq` flag applies a [jq](https://jqlang.github.io/jq/) expression to command output, so results can be reshaped and extracted without piping to an external `jq` binary (dtctl stays self-sufficient for troubleshooting agents); it is powered by the pure-Go [`gojq`](https://github.com/itchyny/gojq) engine, so no system `jq` is required: `dtctl query 'fetch logs | sort timestamp desc | limit 100' -o yaml --jq '.records[].timestamp'`; the filter operates on the structured `json`, `yaml`, and `toon` formats, and any non-structured format (e.g. `table`, `csv`) is auto-promoted to `json` when `--jq` is supplied; an invalid filter expression fails fast with an `invalid --jq filter` error (surfaced in the agent-mode error envelope as well); closes [#272](https://github.com/dynatrace-oss/dtctl/issues/272), fixes [#271](https://github.com/dynatrace-oss/dtctl/pull/271)

## [0.29.0] - 2026-06-11

### Added
- **Azure `clientSecret` connections can now be created and rotated entirely from the CLI** — `dtctl create azure connection` and `dtctl update azure connection` accept `--directoryId`, `--applicationId`, and `--clientSecret` flags, so a `clientSecret`-type connection can be set up in a single command without authoring a YAML file; `--clientSecret` on `update` enables zero-downtime secret rotation (pair with `az ad app credential reset --append`); passing these flags together with `--type federatedIdentityCredential` returns a clear validation error; the Azure section of `docs/site/_docs/cloud-integrations.md` was rewritten with `$VAR`-based federated (Option A) and clientSecret (Option B) walkthroughs; fixes [#264](https://github.com/dynatrace-oss/dtctl/pull/264)
- **`dtctl get workflows` and `dtctl get workflow-executions` gain filtering, pagination, and a per-resource `--limit`** — workflows can be filtered by `--filter` (title search), `--type standard|simple`, `--trigger Manual|Schedule|Event`, and `--mine`, and now render a **TRIGGER** column mirroring the Workflows app; executions can be filtered by `-w/--workflow`, `--state`, `--trigger` (incl. `Workflow`), `--started-since`, and `--started-until` (accepting `YYYY-MM-DD` or ISO 8601, date-only `--started-until` snapping to end-of-day, all normalized to UTC); a new `--limit` flag caps total results — kubectl-style for the bounded workflow list (`0` = unlimited) and `gh run list`-style for the effectively unbounded execution list (default 100, hard cap 1000) — and is distinct from `--chunk-size`, which remains the page size; list requests now project only the displayed fields for leaner payloads, workflow listing rejects a `--chunk-size` of `1..19` as an anti-DoS floor, trigger-type input is case-normalized, and agent mode now reports `HasMore` when the server total exceeds the returned rows (previously a silent truncation); fixes [#269](https://github.com/dynatrace-oss/dtctl/pull/269)

### Changed
- **Dependency bumps** — OpenTelemetry packages (`go.opentelemetry.io/otel`, `otel/sdk`, `otel/trace`, `otel/exporters/otlp/otlptrace/otlptracehttp`) 1.43.0 → 1.44.0 ([#263](https://github.com/dynatrace-oss/dtctl/pull/263), [#260](https://github.com/dynatrace-oss/dtctl/pull/260), [#261](https://github.com/dynatrace-oss/dtctl/pull/261), [#262](https://github.com/dynatrace-oss/dtctl/pull/262))

### Fixed
- **Manual-trigger workflows now round-trip through `dtctl get workflow -o yaml|json | dtctl apply`** — workflows with a manual trigger serialize without a `trigger` field (`Trigger` is `nil`, `omitempty`), but the apply resource-type heuristic required **both** `tasks` and `trigger` to be present, so an exported manual workflow failed re-apply with `could not detect resource type from file content` (affecting both JSON and YAML, since the heuristic was introduced); detection now keys on the `tasks` field alone — unique to workflows and always present — matching the AutomationEngine API where `trigger` is optional/nullable; fixes [#274](https://github.com/dynatrace-oss/dtctl/pull/274)
- **`dtctl create breakpoint` now fails fast when the live-debugger workspace has no entity filters** — a breakpoint created against a workspace with no configured `filterSets` appeared `Active` but was never distributed to any OneAgent, with no error or warning; a pre-flight check now inspects the workspace's filter sets and aborts with an actionable error pointing at `dtctl update breakpoint --filters` when none are configured; the SDK `Workspace` type decodes `filterSets` from the `getOrCreateUserWorkspaceV2` response and exposes a `WorkspaceHasFilters` helper (re-exported through `pkg`); fixes [#267](https://github.com/dynatrace-oss/dtctl/issues/267)

### Security
- **Auto-discovered local `.dtctl.yaml` no longer honors command aliases or apply hooks** — `dtctl` discovers a per-project `.dtctl.yaml` by walking up from the current working directory. Such a file is now treated as untrusted: command aliases and `pre-apply`/`post-apply` hooks defined in it are ignored (contexts, tokens, and other preferences are still honored), with a warning printed to stderr naming the config in effect. These keys can run external commands, so they are honored only from the global config (`~/.config/dtctl/config`) or a config passed explicitly with `--config`, which have stronger ownership expectations. As defense in depth, the built-in-command shadow guard — previously enforced only when an alias was created via `dtctl alias set`/`import` — is now also enforced at resolution time, so an alias written directly into any config file can never override a built-in such as `get`, `apply`, or `version`; fixes [#268](https://github.com/dynatrace-oss/dtctl/pull/268)
- **Go toolchain bumped from 1.26.3 to 1.26.4** — fixes two `govulncheck` findings in the Go standard library: [GO-2025-3749](https://pkg.go.dev/vuln/GO-2025-3749) (`textproto.Reader.ReadMIMEHeader`, reachable from `pkg/auth/oauth_flow.go`) and [GO-2026-5037](https://pkg.go.dev/vuln/GO-2026-5037) (inefficient candidate-hostname parsing in `crypto/x509`, reachable from `pkg/commands/howto.go` and `pkg/output/table.go`); `go-version` is pinned to `1.26.4` across the `build`, `lint`, `release`, `sdk`, `security`, and `test` workflows; fixes [#266](https://github.com/dynatrace-oss/dtctl/pull/266)

## [0.28.1] - 2026-05-29

### Fixed
- **`dtctl apply --id` and `--write-id --id` now trigger UPDATE for settings objects** — the `--id` CLI flag (which injects `doc["id"]` into the resource payload) was being silently ignored when the resource was a Settings 2.0 object; `applySettings` only inspected `objectId` (camelCase) and `objectid` (lowercase) to decide between POST and PUT, so every invocation with `--id` still sent a POST (CREATE) — returning HTTP 400 from the DT Settings API when an object with the same `identifier` already existed; `doc["id"]` is now accepted as a final fallback in the objectID resolution chain, so the flag behaves consistently for settings objects as it does for dashboards, notebooks, and workflows; fixes [#255](https://github.com/dynatrace-oss/dtctl/issues/255)
- **`dtctl apply --dry-run` now correctly reports `"action": "updated"` for settings objects that carry `objectId` or `objectid`** — the dry-run code path checked `doc["id"]` (never present on settings objects) to determine the planned action, so it always returned `"action": "created"` regardless of what was in the file; for `ResourceSettings`, dry-run now also checks `objectId` and `objectid`, matching the logic used by actual apply — so a file produced by `dtctl get settings -o yaml` (which includes `objectid:`) reports `"updated"` in dry-run, as expected; fixes [#256](https://github.com/dynatrace-oss/dtctl/issues/256)

## [0.28.0] - 2026-05-26

### Added
- **AWS provider support** — full feature parity with the Azure and GCP providers (`get`, `describe`, `create`, `update`, `delete`, `enable`, `apply`) for `aws connection` (Settings 2.0 schema `builtin:hyperscaler-authentication.connections.aws`, role-based authentication only) and `aws monitoring` (extension `com.dynatrace.extension.da-aws`); `dtctl create aws connection` prints a copy-paste `aws cloudformation deploy` one-liner that provisions the Dynatrace monitoring IAM role from the official upstream template (`da-aws-nested-monitoring-role.yaml`) with the **least-privilege managed policies** maintained by Dynatrace — instead of the broad `arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/ReadOnlyAccess` previously suggested; the upstream template handles the trust policy (Principal + `sts:ExternalId` via parameters), so `dtctl` no longer writes a `trust-policy.json` to the current working directory; `dtctl get aws monitoring-regions` and `dtctl get aws monitoring-feature-sets` expose the schema enums for discovery; example manifests in `examples/aws_connection.yaml` and `examples/aws_monitoring_config.yaml`; fixes [#240](https://github.com/dynatrace-oss/dtctl/pull/240)
- **`dt-cli-sdk` published as a second Go module (`github.com/dynatrace-oss/dtctl/sdk`)** — the lower-level building blocks that power dtctl are now reusable from sibling Go CLIs and tools via `go get`; the module ships five top-level packages — `sdk/urls` (environment URL validation/normalization), `sdk/auth` (token type detection for classic API tokens, platform tokens, and OAuth JWTs), `sdk/httpclient` (typed HTTP client with retry, pagination, response helpers, and structured error types), `sdk/credstore` (OS keyring + file-based credential storage), and `sdk/agentmode` (AI agent environment detection and JSON-envelope helpers); root `pkg/` callers (`pkg/aidetect`, `pkg/client`, `pkg/diagnostic/urlcheck`) now delegate to the SDK so behaviour is identical to previous releases; the SDK has its own `go.mod`, CI workflow (`.github/workflows/sdk.yml`) with a cross-platform test matrix, dependabot config, CODEOWNERS, and Makefile targets (`test-sdk`, `vet-sdk`, `lint-sdk`, `sdk-check-deps`, `sdk-check-imports`); the root `go.mod` carries a `replace` directive for local development; first SDK release is tagged `sdk/v0.2.0` (see [docs/sdk-migration.md](docs/sdk-migration.md) for the contributor migration guide); fixes [#225](https://github.com/dynatrace-oss/dtctl/pull/225), [#235](https://github.com/dynatrace-oss/dtctl/pull/235)
- **Typed REST API wrappers under `sdk/api/`** — the SDK now exposes resource-specific, typed wrappers over `httpclient.Client` for the Dynatrace platform APIs that dtctl uses internally, so external consumers can call Dynatrace without re-implementing pagination, error decoding, or response unwrapping; root `pkg/resources/` handlers in dtctl are progressively migrating to thin CLI shims that delegate to these SDK wrappers (file I/O, display, and name resolution remain in `pkg/resources/`); fixes [#239](https://github.com/dynatrace-oss/dtctl/pull/239)
- **`sdk/api/query/` — typed DQL query API for the SDK** — extracts the DQL execute/poll/cancel/verify flow into its own package so SDK consumers can run Grail queries with structured request/response types, automatic polling, and cancellation support without depending on the dtctl CLI binary; the root `dtctl query` and `dtctl verify query` commands now delegate to this package; fixes [#241](https://github.com/dynatrace-oss/dtctl/pull/241)
- **Nix flake support** — `flake.nix` + `flake.lock` are now checked in, so users on NixOS or with the Nix package manager can build and run dtctl reproducibly via `nix build` / `nix run github:dynatrace-oss/dtctl`; fixes [#224](https://github.com/dynatrace-oss/dtctl/pull/224)
- **`dtctl exec workflow --input` flag for typed JSON workflow input** — pass a full JSON object as the workflow's input payload (e.g. `dtctl exec workflow my-wf --input '{"severity":"high","ttl":3}'`), which is the modern Workflows API shape; the previous `--params key=value` form remains supported for simple string-keyed parameter maps but is now documented as the legacy form; `--input` must be a JSON object (not a scalar or array) and may only be provided once per invocation; fixes [#221](https://github.com/dynatrace-oss/dtctl/issues/221)
- **`dtctl exec workflow --wait` now works for "simple" (unmonitored) workflows** — `--wait` previously hung indefinitely on a workflow whose definition had `monitored: false`, because the post-execution polling API only returns details for monitored runs; `dtctl exec workflow ... --wait` now appends `?monitor=true` to the launch request, opting the run into the monitored surface so the wait loop can poll completion and surface task results regardless of the workflow's default monitoring setting; without `--wait`, behaviour is unchanged (no `monitor` param sent); fixes [#247](https://github.com/dynatrace-oss/dtctl/pull/247)

### Changed
- **`dtctl describe workflow` now preserves the full workflow definition in JSON/YAML output** — the previous implementation flattened the workflow into a hand-curated table view and dropped the nested `definition` (tasks, triggers, connections, parameters, error policy) from `-o json` and `-o yaml`, so `dtctl describe workflow <id> -o yaml | dtctl apply -f -` round-trips lost the actual task graph; the structured outputs now carry the unmodified `Workflow` payload while the table view keeps its concise summary; golden tests refreshed for `describe workflow` and `get workflows` (json/yaml/toon/agent/csv/table/wide); fixes [#246](https://github.com/dynatrace-oss/dtctl/pull/246)
- **`dtctl query` now sends `pollingPromiseSeconds: 5` on every DQL `query:execute`** — instructs the backend to auto-cancel a running query if dtctl does not issue the next poll within 5 seconds, protecting backend resources from abandoned queries; dtctl's poll loop already re-polls immediately after each long-poll returns RUNNING (client-side gap is microseconds), so the value is hardcoded with no CLI flag; a regression test pins the poll-to-poll gap at `< 1 second` to catch any sleep/backoff that would push real queries over the budget; fixes [#250](https://github.com/dynatrace-oss/dtctl/pull/250)
- **`github.com/olekukonko/tablewriter` upgraded from v0.0.5 to v1.1.4 (major rewrite)** — `pkg/output/table.go` was migrated to the new configuration-driven API (`NewTable` + option functions and a `Config` struct replace the old `NewWriter` + `Set*` methods); table rendering is functionally unchanged for end users, but the upgrade brings in upstream fixes for Unicode display width, ANSI escape handling, and `mattn/go-runewidth` v0.0.19; transitive dependencies `github.com/mattn/go-colorable`, `github.com/mattn/go-isatty`, `github.com/olekukonko/{cat,errors,ll}`, `github.com/clipperhouse/{displaywidth,uax29}`, and `github.com/fatih/color` are now part of the build graph; fixes [#236](https://github.com/dynatrace-oss/dtctl/pull/236)
- **`sdk/httpclient` now honours the injected `Logger`** — the retry path in the SDK HTTP client previously discarded log output even when a `Logger` was supplied at construction time; warnings about retried requests, rate limiting, and transient failures now reach the configured logger so SDK consumers can correlate retries with their own request traces; fixes [#235](https://github.com/dynatrace-oss/dtctl/pull/235)
- **Dependency bumps** — `github.com/spf13/cobra` 1.8.0 → 1.10.2 ([#243](https://github.com/dynatrace-oss/dtctl/pull/243)), `github.com/spf13/viper` 1.18.0 → 1.21.0 ([#244](https://github.com/dynatrace-oss/dtctl/pull/244)), `github.com/spf13/pflag` 1.0.5 → 1.0.10 ([#232](https://github.com/dynatrace-oss/dtctl/pull/232)), `github.com/sirupsen/logrus` 1.9.3 → 1.9.4 ([#227](https://github.com/dynatrace-oss/dtctl/pull/227)), `github.com/guptarohit/asciigraph` 0.7.3 → 0.9.0 ([#242](https://github.com/dynatrace-oss/dtctl/pull/242)), `golang.org/x/sys` 0.44.0 → 0.45.0 ([#251](https://github.com/dynatrace-oss/dtctl/pull/251)), `github.com/go-resty/resty/v2` → v2.17.2, `github.com/godbus/dbus/v5` → v5.2.2, `github.com/zalando/go-keyring` → v0.2.8 (root and SDK modules; [#237](https://github.com/dynatrace-oss/dtctl/pull/237))

### Fixed
- **Concurrent `dtctl` processes no longer race on OAuth refresh-token rotation** — when two or more `dtctl` invocations (e.g. parallel CI jobs sharing a single keyring entry) attempted to refresh a soon-to-expire OAuth token simultaneously, all of them sent the same one-time `refresh_token` to the IdP — only one rotation succeeded and the others failed with `invalid_grant`, leaving subsequent commands without a usable session; the refresh path now takes a cross-process advisory `flock(2)` lock keyed by the credential identity (on Unix), so the second-and-later processes block until the first finishes and then re-read the rotated token; an in-process keyed mutex provides equivalent intra-process serialisation on Windows (full cross-process `LockFileEx` is a documented follow-up); also fixes a latent bug where "medium-compact" keyring entries (access token stripped to save keyring size, but `expires_at` preserved) silently returned an empty access token instead of triggering a refresh; fixes [#248](https://github.com/dynatrace-oss/dtctl/issues/248)
- **Pagination for cloud connection and monitoring lists (AWS, Azure, GCP)** — `dtctl get {aws,azure,gcp} connections` and `dtctl get {aws,azure,gcp} monitoring` previously fetched only the first page of results (`List` ignored `nextPageKey`), silently truncating output in tenants with many connections or monitoring configs; all six list operations now iterate through pages, respecting the Settings 2.0 constraint (page 2+ must send only `nextPageKey`, no `pageSize`/`schemaIds`/`scopes`) and the Extensions 2.0 constraint (no `page-size` with `next-page-key`); regression tests cover both API styles and assert the constraint guard
- **Removed spurious `If-Match: <schemaVersion>` header on AWS connection update** — Settings 2.0 does not use HTTP ETag for optimistic locking, and `schemaVersion` is the schema's semver (e.g. `"1.0.27"`), not an object ETag; the header was previously ignored by the API but would have caused 412 errors if the API ever started honouring it; concurrency is enforced server-side and surfaces as HTTP 409
- **`TestSettingsListObjectsInvalidSchema` no longer flakes against current API wording** — the Dynatrace Settings API now reports a missing schema as `Configuration schema ... does not exist` instead of the older `not found` phrasing (still HTTP 404); the integration test now accepts either wording (and falls back to the `404` status string) so upstream message drift no longer fails the suite; fixes [#252](https://github.com/dynatrace-oss/dtctl/pull/252)
- **Trash restore no longer panics on duplicate-name documents** — the Dynatrace Document API now permits restoring a trashed document whose name conflicts with an existing document, but the integration test still expected the old error and crashed with a nil pointer dereference when the call succeeded; the test now asserts success on plain `restore` (no `--force` needed); this is a test-only fix — `dtctl restore` itself was already working against current API behaviour; fixes [#238](https://github.com/dynatrace-oss/dtctl/pull/238)

### Security
- **`golang.org/x/net` bumped from v0.17.0 to v0.54.0** — picks up upstream HTTP/2 and `net/http` hardening fixes carried by the SDK's `httpclient` and the root binary's REST calls; fixes [#235](https://github.com/dynatrace-oss/dtctl/pull/235)

### Documentation
- **SDK contributor migration guide ([`docs/sdk-migration.md`](docs/sdk-migration.md))** — explains how the `sdk/` module is laid out, when to add new code to `sdk/` vs `pkg/`, how the `replace` directive interacts with `go get` consumers, and how to coordinate a paired root + SDK release; fixes [#235](https://github.com/dynatrace-oss/dtctl/pull/235)
- **AWS onboarding guide in `docs/QUICK_START.md` and `docs/site/_docs/cloud-integrations.md`** — mirrors the existing Azure/GCP walkthroughs for the new AWS provider: connection creation, CloudFormation-driven IAM role provisioning, role ARN patch-back, monitoring config create/enable, and region/feature-set discovery; fixes [#240](https://github.com/dynatrace-oss/dtctl/pull/240)
- **DQL reference now prefers `smartscapeNodes` over legacy `dt.entity.*` queries** — the dtctl skill's DQL reference was steering AI agents and users at the older entity-based DQL surface for topology queries; the reference now leads with `smartscapeNodes` patterns and keeps the `dt.entity.*` examples as a fallback, matching the rest of the dt-migration guidance; fixes [#245](https://github.com/dynatrace-oss/dtctl/pull/245)
- **Root README mentions the `sdk/api/query` package** — the README's SDK packages listing was missing the new DQL query API; fixes b2b82ec

## [0.27.1] - 2026-05-11

### Security
- **Bumped Go toolchain to 1.26.3 and `golang.org/x/net` to v0.53.0** — fixes four `govulncheck` findings affecting `main`: [GO-2026-4982](https://pkg.go.dev/vuln/GO-2026-4982) and [GO-2026-4980](https://pkg.go.dev/vuln/GO-2026-4980) (XSS via `html/template` escaper bypass, reachable from the OAuth callback server), [GO-2026-4971](https://pkg.go.dev/vuln/GO-2026-4971) (panic in `net.Dial`/`LookupPort` on Windows for inputs containing a NUL byte, reachable from the OAuth flow and keyring init), and [GO-2026-4918](https://pkg.go.dev/vuln/GO-2026-4918) (HTTP/2 transport infinite loop on a malformed `SETTINGS_MAX_FRAME_SIZE`, reachable from any HTTPS client request); CI `go-version` pinned to `1.26.3` across `build.yml`, `lint.yml`, `release.yml`, `security.yml`, `test.yml`

### Fixed
- **`dtctl commands -o json` now reports the `enable` verb as mutating** — the structured command catalog reported `enable` with `"mutating": false` and an empty `safety_operation`, even though `dtctl enable gcp monitoring` and `dtctl enable azure monitoring` go through `SetupWithSafety(safety.OperationUpdate)` and `PUT` updated monitoring/credential config to the tenant; consumers of the catalog (AI agents, plugins, CI policy gates) consequently misclassified `enable` as read-only; `enable` is now listed in `commands.MutatingVerbs` with `OperationUpdate`, and the drift-detection test (`TestMutatingVerbsMatchSafetyCheckerUsage`) now scans for both `NewSafetyChecker` and `SetupWithSafety(` call sites so future verbs wired up exclusively via the helper cannot silently regress the same way; runtime safety enforcement was unaffected (the actual `enable` commands already enforced `OperationUpdate`); fixes [#203](https://github.com/dynatrace-oss/dtctl/issues/203)
- **`dtctl get anomaly-detector -o json|yaml` output is now consumable by `dtctl apply -f`** — get previously serialized a hybrid shape mixing top-level table-display fields (e.g. `analyzer` as the short string `"static (>90)"`, `eventType`) with a nested `value` containing the real Settings payload, which the apply detector recognized as neither the raw Settings format nor the flattened authoring format and rejected with `Error: could not detect resource type from file content`; the `AnomalyDetector` struct now serializes the raw Settings envelope (`{schemaId, scope, value, objectId, schemaVersion}`) via custom `MarshalJSON`/`MarshalYAML`, matching dashboard/notebook/SLO behavior — `dtctl get anomaly-detector <id> -o json > file.json && dtctl apply -f file.json` now round-trips cleanly and is the supported way to copy detectors between environments; table/wide/csv output is unchanged; fixes [#216](https://github.com/dynatrace-oss/dtctl/issues/216)
- **`dtctl get dashboards --filter` no longer returns notebooks and other document types** — when `--filter` was supplied, the implicit `type=='dashboard'` (or `type=='notebook'`) constraint was silently dropped from the Document API request, returning *all* document types matching the user's filter expression; the implicit type is now always ANDed into the raw filter so `dtctl get dashboards --filter 'name contains "prod"'` returns only dashboards; help text for `--filter` updated accordingly (it no longer "overrides" `--type`); fixes [#213](https://github.com/dynatrace-oss/dtctl/issues/213)
- **`--add-fields` now actually surfaces requested fields in JSON/YAML output (and survives `--watch`)** — fields like `originAppId`, `originExtensionId`, `labels`, `shareInfo`, `userContext` requested via `--add-fields` were lost during the internal `DocumentMetadata → Document` conversion, so `-o json|yaml` returned the standard field set regardless; the optional fields are now carried through `Document` itself (with `omitempty` + `table:"-"` so default table layout is unchanged), the YAML marshaller copies them into the output map alongside JSON, and `--watch --add-fields ...` shares the same conversion path so it no longer silently drops the requested fields; fixes [#213](https://github.com/dynatrace-oss/dtctl/issues/213)
- **Platform token creation instructions now point at the correct URL** — `docs/site/_docs/configuration.md`, `docs/QUICK_START.md`, and the `dtctl auth login` keyring-unavailable error suggestion told users to navigate to `Identity & Access Management > Access Tokens` inside the Dynatrace platform UI, but that path leads to *classic* API tokens (`dt0c01.*`); platform tokens (`dt0s16.*`, the format dtctl uses) are managed exclusively via the Account Management portal at `https://myaccount.dynatrace.com/platformTokens`; all three locations now point at the correct URL; fixes [#201](https://github.com/dynatrace-oss/dtctl/issues/201)
- **`--mine` filter no longer crashes on platform tokens** — `dtctl get dashboards --mine` (and `get documents`/`get workflows --mine`) failed with `failed to parse JWT claims: invalid character '#' looking for beginning of value` when the configured token was a Dynatrace platform token (`dt0s16.*`) and `/platform/metadata/v1/user` returned 403; the JWT fallback in `Client.CurrentUserID` blindly base64-decoded the middle segment of the platform token, which is not a JWT payload, producing the misleading parse error; `ExtractUserIDFromToken` now rejects platform tokens up front, and `CurrentUserID` returns an actionable message pointing at the missing `app-engine:apps:run` scope; fixes [#210](https://github.com/dynatrace-oss/dtctl/issues/210)

### Changed
- **`dtctl doctor` warning text for platform tokens now identifies the correct scope** — the previous message blamed `iam:users:read`, but `/platform/metadata/v1/user` actually requires `app-engine:apps:run` (which *is* grantable to platform tokens); the warning now reads `platform token: user identity unavailable via metadata API (token likely lacks 'app-engine:apps:run' scope; platform tokens are not JWTs, so no fallback)`, which correctly tells users how to fix it

### Documentation
- **Dashboard skill: complete coloring guide for AI agents** — replaced the misleading "Thresholds (color rules)" section in `skills/dtctl/references/resources/dashboards.md` with a full "Coloring" reference covering all three systems Dynatrace uses (`coloring.colorRules` for singleValue/table tiles, `coloring.thresholdRules` for line/area chart background zones, and the legacy `visualization.thresholds` round-trip artifact); previous guidance steered agents toward `thresholds`, which the UI silently converts to `colorRules` on save while dropping any rule without an explicit lower bound, leaving tiles white with no error; new docs include the `value: -1` catch-all sentinel pattern, higher-is-better/lower-is-better direction examples, and a `toLong()` type-coercion pitfall callout; fixes [#215](https://github.com/dynatrace-oss/dtctl/issues/215)

## [0.27.0] - 2026-05-05

### Added
- **`--filter`, `--sort`, `--add-fields`, `--admin-access` flags for `get dashboards`, `get notebooks`, `get documents`** — exposes four Document API query parameters previously unavailable in the CLI: `--filter` sends a raw Document API filter expression verbatim (overrides `--name`/`--type`/`--mine`); `--sort` accepts comma-separated field names, prefix with `-` for descending (e.g. `"name,-modificationInfo.lastModifiedTime"`); `--add-fields` requests fields the API omits by default (e.g. `originExtensionId`, `labels`, `shareInfo.isShared`); `--admin-access` lists documents as effective owner and requires the `document:documents:admin` permission; fixes [#196](https://github.com/dynatrace-oss/dtctl/issues/196)
- **`hooks.post-apply` configuration option** — a new hook that runs after a successful `dtctl apply`, complementing the existing `pre-apply` hook; receives the apply result envelope as JSON on stdin, with both stdout and stderr forwarded to the user; a non-zero exit is treated as a warning (the resource is already persisted, so the overall command exit code is not flipped); for batch applies the post-apply hook now also fires on partial success — items 1..N-1 that succeeded before item N failed still trigger the hook, so notify/cleanup pipelines no longer miss partial results; configurable globally or per-context (set to `none` to disable); fixes [#189](https://github.com/dynatrace-oss/dtctl/issues/189)
- **Pre-apply hook now captures and forwards stdout/stderr** — output from a `pre-apply` hook script is now displayed to the user (previously suppressed), so diagnostics from validators, linters, or approval prompts are visible during apply; in `--agent`/`-A` mode hook output is routed to stderr instead of stdout to keep the JSON envelope on stdout machine-parseable

### Changed
- **Pre-apply hooks are now exec'd directly with POSIX-style tokenization (no `sh -c` wrapper)** — hook commands are tokenized with [google/shlex](https://github.com/google/shlex), then exec'd directly with `<resource-type>` and `<source-file>` appended as the final two positional args; this lets hook scripts reach `$1`/`$2`/`$@` reliably and correctly handles quoted arguments and paths containing spaces (e.g. `bash "/Users/joe/Library/Application Support/hook.sh"`); pipes, redirections, and globbing now require an explicit interpreter inside the script (e.g. `bash -c '<cmd> | <cmd>'`) since there is no shell wrapper anymore; malformed quoting raises a clear error instead of silently mistokenizing; **users who relied on shell features in their hook command strings will need to migrate them into a wrapped script**; fixes [#189](https://github.com/dynatrace-oss/dtctl/issues/189)
- **Config env expansion preserves shell positional parameters** — `os.ExpandEnv` over the raw YAML at config load was rewriting `$1`, `$2`, `$@`, `$*`, `$#`, `$?`, `$!`, `$$`, `$-`, `$0`, `${10}` to the empty string before any consumer (notably hooks) could see them; expansion now matches only real env-var names (`[A-Za-z_][A-Za-z0-9_]*`) and leaves shell positional/special tokens verbatim; behaviour is otherwise unchanged (undefined `${VAR}` still expands to `""`); the same trap could silently corrupt any string field in the config, not just hook commands

### Removed
- **UID/objectId-based addressing for settings objects (potentially breaking)** — `dtctl describe|edit|delete setting <uid>` no longer accepts the synthetic UID/UUID identifier, the `--schema`/`--scope` UID-resolution flags are gone, and the `UID` column has been removed from `dtctl get settings` table output; scope type and scope ID are now derived from the stable API-provided `scope` field instead of being reverse-engineered from the opaque `objectId` blob; this also eliminates the O(N) UID resolution path that listed all settings objects across all scopes; **scripts and automation that addressed settings objects by UID must switch to the API-stable `objectId` (visible in `-o json` / `-o yaml` output)**; fixes [#207](https://github.com/dynatrace-oss/dtctl/pull/207)

### Fixed
- **`enable gcp monitoring` once again updates the linked connection's service account** — 0.26.1 (#197) replaced the connection-update step with a validation-only check, but the Dynatrace extension API rejects the monitoring-config update when the credential's `serviceAccount` does not match the SA on the linked connection (`Invalid service account ID provided`); fresh, UI-created connections that have no SA set therefore could not be enabled in a single step; `dtctl enable gcp monitoring --serviceAccountId <sa>` now updates the linked GCP connection with service account impersonation before enabling the monitoring config (mirroring `dtctl update gcp connection`); when `--serviceAccountId` is omitted, the connection is left untouched and only the monitoring config is enabled; multi-credential configs still have only their first credential's connection updated — use `dtctl update gcp connection` for the rest; fixes the regression introduced by [#197](https://github.com/dynatrace-oss/dtctl/pull/197)
- **`dtctl doctor` no longer fails on platform tokens** — the authentication check called `/platform/metadata/v1/user`, which requires the `iam:users:read` scope; platform tokens (`dt0s16.*`) cannot currently be granted that scope, so the call always returned `403 Forbidden` and `doctor` reported `[FAIL] Authentication API call failed: failed to fetch user info: 403 Forbidden`; the check now detects platform tokens via `client.IsPlatformToken` and surfaces this as a `warn` with an explanation (`platform token: user identity unavailable via metadata API`) instead of failing the run; OAuth/JWT tokens keep the existing metadata-API + JWT-fallback behaviour; fixes [#190](https://github.com/dynatrace-oss/dtctl/issues/190)
- **`dtctl config set-credentials` now invalidates stale OAuth token cache** — when a platform token is rotated and re-added under the same name, the cached OAuth access/refresh tokens from the previous credential are now deleted from both the OS keyring and the file-based token store; previously the cached refresh token would be reused, causing `token expired and refresh failed` errors even after supplying a fresh platform token
- **Stale OAuth session no longer blocks platform token fallback** — when a cached OAuth refresh token has been revoked server-side (`invalid_grant`), dtctl now automatically evicts the stale cache entry and falls back to the underlying platform token stored via `dtctl config set-credentials`; previously the `invalid_grant` error was surfaced directly, requiring the user to either create a new token name or manually re-run `set-credentials` to clear the cache
- **`dtctl auth login` prunes empty placeholder contexts created by `dtctl config init`** — `dtctl config init` writes a template context (e.g. `my-environment` with `environment: ""` or `environment: "${DT_ENVIRONMENT_URL}"`); after `dtctl auth login --context <name>` adds the real context, the unused placeholder is now removed automatically so the saved config contains only working contexts; only contexts whose effective environment is empty (literally empty *or* an unset `${VAR}` reference) are pruned, and the active/just-logged-in context is always kept — env-var-backed contexts whose variable simply isn't set in the current shell (e.g. `CI_DT_URL` outside CI) are preserved across login; fixes [#199](https://github.com/dynatrace-oss/dtctl/issues/199)

## [0.26.2] - 2026-04-29

### Added
- **`--client-context` flag for `query` and `verify query`** — passes a caller-supplied semantic string (e.g. `"root-cause-analysis"`, `"incident-response"`) to the Dynatrace backend via the new `dt-client-context` request header on all DQL query API calls (`query:execute`, `query:poll`, `query:cancel`, `query:verify`); the header also carries the dtctl version and, when dtctl is running under a known AI agent (Claude Code, Cursor, GitHub Copilot, etc.), the agent name — giving the Dynatrace backend structured, attributable context about who is issuing queries and why; fixes [#195](https://github.com/dynatrace-oss/dtctl/pull/195)

## [0.26.1] - 2026-04-28

### Fixed
- **`enable gcp monitoring` now handles UI-created configs with an empty `serviceAccount` field** — GCP monitoring configurations created through the Dynatrace UI store an empty string (`""`) in `credentials[].serviceAccount`; when `dtctl enable gcp monitoring --serviceAccountId <sa>` issued a `PUT` with this field unchanged, the API rejected the request with HTTP 400 (`serviceAccount '' violates Size must be between 1 and 500`); `dtctl enable gcp monitoring` now validates that `--serviceAccountId` matches the service account on the linked GCP connection and writes it into the monitoring config's credential payload before the `PUT`, so UI-created configs can be enabled in one step without manual JSON editing; updating connection credentials remains the responsibility of `dtctl update gcp connection`; fixes [#197](https://github.com/dynatrace-oss/dtctl/pull/197)

## [0.26.0] - 2026-04-28

### Added
- **DQL query cancellation on Ctrl+C** — interrupting `dtctl query` while a query is polling now explicitly cancels the running Grail query via `POST /query:cancel` (best-effort, 3 s timeout) before exiting, preventing orphaned server-side jobs; Ctrl+C in `--live` mode now exits immediately instead of waiting for the current fetch to complete; spurious resty WARN/ERROR log output on context cancellation is also suppressed; fixes [#188](https://github.com/dynatrace-oss/dtctl/issues/188)
- **`app-settings:objects:read` OAuth scope** — added to all safety levels so that app functions that access app-settings APIs can be invoked without a 403; fixes [#171](https://github.com/dynatrace-oss/dtctl/issues/171)
- **`iam:service-users:use` OAuth scope** — added to the `readwrite-mine`, `readwrite-all`, and `dangerously-unrestricted` safety levels so `dtctl create workflow` can use a Dynatrace [service user as the workflow actor](https://docs.dynatrace.com/docs/analyze-explore-automate/workflows/security#service-users); existing sessions need to re-run `dtctl auth login` to pick up the new scope; note that this slightly broadens the privilege footprint of `readwrite-mine` since holders can now act as a service user when creating workflows

### Fixed
- **Eight `--watch` mode correctness bugs** — `--watch-only` no longer floods output with false `ADDED` events on the first poll (differ baseline was never seeded); `Watcher.Stop()` no longer panics on a second call (guarded with `sync.Once`); Ctrl+C no longer hangs for seconds during rate-limit or network-error backoff (`time.Sleep` replaced with a context-aware helper); `Retry-After` headers on HTTP 429 responses are now parsed and honoured instead of always being ignored (stub replaced with a real parser, capped at 5 min); `--interval` values below 1 s are now correctly clamped to 1 s instead of 2 s; `--watch`/`--watch-only` flags no longer appear in `--help` for commands that never call `executeWithWatch` (`buckets`, `slos`, `notifications`, `workflow-executions`, `extensions`, `segments`); transient errors (timeout, temporary failure, connection reset) now back off for one interval before retrying instead of hammering the endpoint immediately; resources keyed by `objectId`/`entityId` (no `id`/`name` field) now participate in change detection via a stable content hash instead of being silently dropped every poll; fixes [#189](https://github.com/dynatrace-oss/dtctl/issues/189)
- **`create lookup` now handles CSV files with a UTF-8 BOM** — Excel on macOS/Windows and many editors prepend a byte order mark (`EF BB BF`) when saving as CSV; the BOM was previously embedded in the first column name during parse-pattern auto-detection, producing a DPL pattern the upload API rejected with `Syntax error: extraneous input ''`; the BOM is now stripped before the header is parsed; fixes [#187](https://github.com/dynatrace-oss/dtctl/issues/187)

## [0.25.2] - 2026-04-22

### Fixed
- **ANSI/VT escape sequence processing on Windows** — `dtctl` output now renders colours and progress indicators correctly in Windows Terminal, PowerShell, and cmd.exe; previously the VT processing flag was only set on stdout, leaving stderr unstyled; fixes [#183](https://github.com/dynatrace-oss/dtctl/issues/183)

### Documentation
- Updated token scopes documentation URL

## [0.25.1] - 2026-04-21

### Fixed
- **`apply` now accepts array input for bulk resource updates** — `dtctl apply -f` can now process files containing arrays of resources (e.g., the output of `dtctl get settings --schema ... -o yaml`); each element is applied individually with per-item error reporting so a single failure does not abort the batch; works for all resource types, not just settings; fixes [#180](https://github.com/dynatrace-oss/dtctl/issues/180)

## [0.25.0] - 2026-04-20

### Added
- **`apply --share-environment` flag** — creates an environment-wide share for applied notebooks and dashboards in one step, so newly created documents come up as `isPrivate: false` without a manual UI click; accepts `read` (default when flag is bare) or `read-write`; idempotent: no-ops when a matching share exists, and replaces the share if access level differs; other resource types in the same apply invocation are skipped silently; requires `document:environment-shares:read` + `:write` scopes (already in the `readwrite-all` safety level)
- **`apply --write-id` and `apply --id` flags** — two complementary flags for idempotent applies; `--write-id` stamps the generated resource ID back into the source file after a successful create, so every subsequent apply updates in place without creating duplicates; `--id` injects or overrides the resource ID at the CLI level without modifying the file, ideal for CI pipelines using reusable template files; works for dashboards, notebooks, and workflows; a recovery hint is printed to stderr when a resource is created without `--write-id`
- **Extension installation** — install extensions with `dtctl create extension`; `--hub-extension <id>` installs a Hub catalog extension (optionally pin a release with `--version`); `-f <file.zip>` uploads a custom extension package; `--dry-run` previews without applying; requires the `extensions:definitions:write` token scope
- **Extended `describe extension` command** — `--monitoring-configuration-schema` outputs the JSON Schema for monitoring configurations of a specific extension version; `--active-gate-groups` lists available ActiveGate groups for a version; `--no-fluff` strips `documentation`, `displayName`, and `customMessage` fields from schema output (use with `--monitoring-configuration-schema`)
- **`enable gcp|azure monitoring` command** — new `dtctl enable` verb that completes cloud monitoring onboarding in one step: optionally updates the linked connection credentials (service account for GCP; directory/application ID for Azure) and enables the monitoring config; `--serviceAccountId`, `--directoryId`, `--applicationId` are all optional — if omitted, only the enabled state is toggled; supports `--dry-run`
- **Cloud monitoring configs created as disabled** — `dtctl create gcp monitoring` and `dtctl create azure monitoring` now create configs in a disabled state (`enabled: false`); use `dtctl enable gcp|azure monitoring` to enable
- **`auth status` command** — new `dtctl auth status` subcommand reports OAuth session health for the current context: access token validity and time-to-expiry, refresh token presence and expiry; supports `-o json/yaml` for scripting
- **Doctor "OAuth session" check** — `dtctl doctor` now includes an OAuth session row reporting access token expiry and whether a refresh token is present; row is omitted for platform-token contexts
- **`offline_access` OAuth scope** — all four safety levels now request the OIDC `offline_access` scope, causing the token endpoint to return a refresh token; this enables automatic access-token refresh on every subsequent command without re-running `dtctl auth login`
- **Improved keyring compact-storage fallback** — when a keyring backend rejects the full token payload for being too large, dtctl now tries a medium-compact form first (drops access/ID token JWTs but keeps scope and expiry metadata) before falling back to the minimal form (refresh token + name only); `auth status` remains informative in both compact cases
- **App function custom error detection** — `dtctl exec function` now detects the Dynatrace app-function error envelope (`{"error": "message", "data": ...}`) on HTTP 200 responses and surfaces the error message with a non-zero exit code instead of silently returning success
- **OAuth scopes for Hub catalog and extension definitions** — added `hub:catalog:read` scope to all safety levels (readonly and above) and `extensions:definitions:write` scope to readwrite-all and dangerously-unrestricted levels; fixes #166
- **`token-scopes` help topic** — `dtctl help token-scopes` now works as advertised in error messages, providing a quick reference for required scopes at each safety level

### Fixed
- **`delete notebook|dashboard` now works at `readwrite-mine` and `readwrite-all` safety levels** — the OAuth scopes requested at login were missing `document:documents:delete` for both `readwrite-mine` and `readwrite-all`, so `dtctl delete notebook <id>` returned `403 access denied to document`; document deletion is a soft-delete (moves to trash, recoverable) and does not require `dangerously-unrestricted`; permanent trash purging remains gated to `dangerously-unrestricted`; fixes [#160](https://github.com/dynatrace-oss/dtctl/issues/160)
- **Multi-series chart rendering panic** — fixed a panic in the chart renderer when DQL queries returned multiple series; fixes [#169](https://github.com/dynatrace-oss/dtctl/issues/169)
- **`auth status` no longer claims 'valid' for uncached tokens** — when the access token is not cached locally (compact keyring storage), `auth status` now correctly reports the token state instead of claiming it is valid
- **Environment share fixes** — exact access-level matching, 409 race-condition recovery, correct POST body shape, delete-loop fix, and pagination support for environment shares
- **`create extension --version` rejected with `--file`** — `dtctl create extension -f <file.zip> --version 1.2.3` now returns a clear error explaining that `--version` only applies to Hub installs; 409 conflict errors now include a clarifying message

## [0.24.0] - 2026-04-14

### Added
- **OpenTelemetry distributed tracing** — every dtctl invocation now creates an OpenTelemetry span covering the entire CLI process; export spans via OTLP by setting `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT`; inherits caller trace context from `TRACEPARENT`/`TRACESTATE` environment variables (W3C Trace Context), so dtctl appears as a child span in CI/CD pipelines or other distributed traces; outgoing HTTP requests to Dynatrace APIs carry `traceparent`/`tracestate` headers for end-to-end correlation; non-intrusive — tracing is silently disabled when no exporter is configured; see `docs/OBSERVABILITY.md` for setup guides and examples
- **Hub catalog extensions** — browse the Dynatrace Hub extension catalog with `dtctl get hub-extensions`, `dtctl describe hub-extensions`, and `dtctl get hub-extension-releases`; client-side `--filter` flag for case-insensitive substring matching against name, ID, or description; all commands are read-only
- **File-based OAuth token storage** — new `DTCTL_TOKEN_STORAGE=file` environment variable enables file-based OAuth token persistence as a fallback when the OS keyring is unavailable (headless Linux, WSL, CI/CD, containers); tokens are stored under `$XDG_DATA_HOME/dtctl/oauth-tokens/` with `0600` permissions; `dtctl doctor` reports the active storage backend; all OAuth flows (login, logout, token refresh, DQL queries) work transparently with either backend

### Fixed
- **`auth login --context` uses correct environment URL** — `dtctl auth login --context <name>` previously resolved the environment URL and token name from the *current* context instead of the named one, silently overwriting the target context's URL; now correctly reads from the specified context's configuration
- **Helpful redirect for `update settings`** — users attempting `dtctl update settings` now receive a clear message directing them to use `dtctl apply -f <file>` instead of a confusing unknown-flag error

### Documentation
- **Observability guide** — new `docs/OBSERVABILITY.md` documenting distributed tracing setup, environment variables, CI/CD integration with GitHub Actions examples, and a behavior matrix for all configuration combinations

## [0.23.0] - 2026-04-10

### Added
- **Pre-apply hooks** — run external validation commands before `dtctl apply` sends resources to the API; configure globally via `preferences.hooks.pre-apply` or per-context via `contexts[].context.hooks.pre-apply`; the hook receives the resource type and source file as positional parameters ($1, $2) and the processed JSON on stdin; non-zero exit rejects the apply with the hook's stderr shown to the user; skip with `--no-hooks`; set `pre-apply: none` on a context to disable a global hook for that context
- **Transparent DQL-to-AST filter conversion for segments** — segment filters can now be written as human-readable DQL expressions (e.g., `status == "ERROR"`) instead of raw JSON AST; dtctl transparently converts between the two formats on read and write, so `get`, `describe`, `apply`, and `edit` all work with the DQL form; existing JSON AST filters are passed through unchanged
- **Automatic keyring collection creation** — on Linux/WSL, `dtctl auth login` now detects when a persistent Secret Service keyring collection is missing and offers to create one automatically, prompting for a password if needed; `dtctl doctor` reports keyring status and suggests running `auth login` to recover

### Fixed
- **Segment updates use PATCH instead of PUT** — segment updates now use `PATCH` to avoid overwriting fields not included in the request body; field ordering in responses is preserved for stable `apply` round-trips
- **Improved auth login error when keyring is unavailable** — `auth login` now prints a clear message with recovery steps when the OS keyring cannot be accessed, instead of a raw library error

### Security
- **Go upgraded to 1.26.2** — fixes four stdlib vulnerabilities in `crypto/x509` and `crypto/tls` (applies to all CI workflows and release builds)

## [0.22.0] - 2026-04-01

### Added
- **Custom anomaly detector support** — full CRUD for custom anomaly detectors (`builtin:davis.anomaly-detectors`): `get`, `describe`, `create`, `edit`, `delete`, and `apply`; accepts both flattened YAML format (human-friendly, recommended) and raw Settings API format; source defaults to `"dtctl"` when omitted; `describe` includes recent problems cross-reference via DQL; filter by enabled state with `--enabled` / `--enabled=false`; alias `ad` for brevity (e.g., `dtctl get ad`)
- **DQL auto-refresh OAuth token on 401** — long-running `dtctl query` sessions now automatically refresh the OAuth token when a 401 is received during poll loops, preventing interrupted queries on token expiry

### Fixed
- **Shell completion: bash v2 with zsh alias support** — switched bash completion from v1 (`GenBashCompletion`) to v2 (`GenBashCompletionV2`) which includes a self-contained `__dtctl_init_completion` fallback, eliminating the `_init_completion: command not found` error when the `bash-completion` package is not installed; added `compdef dt=dtctl` instructions for zsh users with aliases; added a note about clearing stale completion files when upgrading
- **Missing safety check on `restore trash`** — `restoreTrashCmd` allowed trash restoration even in `readonly` contexts; now enforces `SetupWithSafety(safety.OperationUpdate)` consistent with all other restore subcommands
- **OAuth messages polluting stdout in agent mode** — interactive browser authentication messages ("Opening browser...", auth URL, fallback instructions) were printed to stdout, corrupting the structured JSON envelope in agent mode (`-A`); these are now redirected to stderr
- **Safety checks enforced for `apply` on settings objects** — `apply` with settings resources now correctly enforces safety checks before making API calls
- **SLO evaluation table output** — fixed formatting issues in SLO evaluation results table output
- **Build version injection** — `make build` and CI build workflow now correctly inject version, commit, and date into the binary via `-ldflags`; previously targeted non-existent `cmd.version` vars instead of `pkg/version.Version`

### Changed
- **Architecture refactor** — reduced boilerplate across command handlers with centralized `SetupClient`/`SetupWithSafety` helpers; split the monolithic `pkg/apply/applier.go` into per-resource files; extracted reusable pagination helper into `pkg/client/pagination.go`; fixed remaining stdout usage in library code

## [0.21.0] - 2026-03-30

### Added
- **Grail filter segments** — full CRUD support for segment management (`get`, `describe`, `create`, `edit`, `delete`, `apply`) plus query-time filtering via `--segment`/`-S`, `--segments-file`, and `--segment-var`/`-V` flags on `dtctl query`; supports inline variable binding with URL-query syntax (`-S "seg?var=val"`); segments are AND-combined per Grail semantics with client-side validation (max 10 per query); supports name resolution so you can pass segment names instead of UIDs

## [0.20.2] - 2026-03-30

### Added
- **Cross-client skill installation** — `dtctl skills install --cross-client` installs skills to the shared `.agents/skills/` directory defined by the [agentskills.io](https://agentskills.io) convention, so any compatible agent automatically discovers them without needing per-agent installation; use `--cross-client --global` to install to `~/.agents/skills/dtctl/` for user-wide availability; `--for cross-client` is also supported on `status` for targeted checks
- **AI Agent Skills documentation** — new "AI Agent Skills" section in the Quick Start guide covering install, cross-client, status, uninstall, and listing agents; new "Skills Management" subsection in the API Design docs

### Fixed
- **`skills status` blank env var in output** — when displaying status for the cross-client pseudo-agent, `printStatus` would produce `"(detected via  env)"` with a blank environment variable name; now correctly omits the detection suffix for agents without an env var
- **Shell completion for `--for cross-client`** — the `--for` flag tab completion on `skills status` now includes `cross-client` as a valid option alongside all per-agent names

### Documentation
- **Improved installation instructions and contribution guidelines** — updated README and CONTRIBUTING.md with clearer setup steps and contributor guidance

## [0.20.1] - 2026-03-25

### Added
- **TOON output for `query` and `verify query`** — `-o toon` is now accepted by `dtctl query` and `dtctl verify query`; previously the command-level format allowlists omitted `toon` even though the printer already supported it
- **`verify query` format validation** — `dtctl verify query` now rejects unsupported output formats with a clear error instead of silently falling through to the human-readable default

## [0.20.0] - 2026-03-24

### Added
- **TOON output format** — new `-o toon` output format using [TOON (Token-Oriented Object Notation)](https://github.com/toon-format/toon), a compact encoding optimised for LLM token efficiency (~40-60% fewer tokens vs JSON for tabular data); use `-A -o toon` in agent mode for maximum token savings
- **Windows installation guide** — comprehensive installation documentation for Windows users, including a PowerShell install script (`install.ps1`) and platform-specific troubleshooting

### Changed
- **`describe` commands respect `-o` flag** — all `describe` subcommands now support `--output json|yaml|toon|csv` and agent mode (`-A`); previously most describe commands hardcoded `fmt.Printf` output and ignored the format flag; fixed partial implementations in `describe lookup` (inverted routing), `describe extension` and `describe extension-config` (dead `outputFormat == ""` check)
- **Live Debugger marked experimental** — Live Debugger features are now documented as experimental; underlying APIs and query behavior may change in future releases

### Fixed
- **Settings API pagination** — fixed HTTP 400 errors on page 2+ when listing settings with filters; the Settings API rejects `schemaIds` and `scopes` query parameters when `nextPageKey` is present (all params are embedded in the page token); these params are now only sent on the first request

## [0.19.1] - 2026-03-20

### Fixed
- **Pagination: filter dropped on page 2+** — all paginated list endpoints placed filter/search query parameters inside the first-page-only branch of the pagination loop; page tokens do not always preserve filter context server-side (confirmed on the Document API), causing subsequent pages to return unfiltered results; e.g., `dtctl get dashboards` on environments with many documents fetched all document types instead of just dashboards
- **Pagination: page-size dropped on page 2+ (Document API)** — the Document API accepts `page-size` alongside `page-key` and does not embed the page size in the token (defaulting to 20/page if omitted); combined with the filter bug, this caused `dtctl get dashboards` on a 1,307-dashboard environment to make ~229 HTTP requests over ~2 minutes instead of 3 requests in ~5 seconds
- **`--chunk-size` default restored to 500** — reverts the v0.19.0 change that set the default to 0 (first page only), which silently truncated results for all resources; the underlying pagination bugs are now fixed properly

### Changed
- **Cleaner CLI output** — centralized message formatting with new `PrintHumanError`, `PrintHint`, `DescribeKV`, `DescribeSection` helpers; bold labels in `describe` output; bold `--help` section headers; softer status colors in tables; fixed table header misalignment caused by a `tablewriter` ANSI-width bug
- **Removed `-o describe` output format** — the redundant `--output describe` format on `get` commands has been removed; use `dtctl describe <resource>` instead

## [0.19.0] - 2026-03-20

### Added
- **Workflow task result retrieval** — new `dtctl get wfe-task-result <execution-id> --task <name>` command retrieves the structured return value of a specific workflow task (e.g., the object returned by a JavaScript task's `default` export function); previously this data was only accessible through the raw REST API
- **`exec workflow --show-results`** — new `--show-results` flag for `dtctl exec workflow --wait` prints each task's structured return value after the execution completes, removing the need for separate `get wfe-task-result` calls per task; in agent mode, task results are included in the JSON envelope
- **Environment URL confusion detection** — dtctl now detects common URL misconfiguration (e.g., `live.dynatrace.com` instead of `apps.dynatrace.com`, bare `dynatrace.com`, or missing `.apps.` on internal domains) and prints corrective suggestions; surfaces in `dtctl doctor` as a dedicated check, as warnings during `auth login` and `ctx set`, and as hints on 401/403/connection errors
- **Junie agent support** — `dtctl skills install --for junie` installs skill files for the Junie IDE agent; includes auto-detection via `JUNIE` env var and both project-local (`.junie/skills/dtctl/`) and global (`~/.junie/skills/dtctl/`) install paths

### Changed
- **Skills: migrate to agentskills.io standard** — `dtctl skills install` now copies the full skill directory (`SKILL.md` + `references/`) using the [agentskills.io](https://agentskills.io) open standard path (`<client>/skills/dtctl/`) instead of agent-specific file formats; YAML frontmatter and relative links are preserved verbatim; existing installations should run `dtctl skills uninstall && dtctl skills install` to migrate
- **Default `--chunk-size` changed from 500 to 0** — list commands now return only the first page of results by default (matching kubectl behavior); this fixes a performance regression where environments with many documents made 200+ sequential API requests taking 4+ minutes; users who need all results should pass `--chunk-size 500` explicitly
- **Global skill installs for more agents** — `dtctl skills install --global` now supports Copilot (`~/.copilot/skills/dtctl/`), OpenCode (`~/.config/opencode/skills/dtctl/`), and Junie (`~/.junie/skills/dtctl/`) in addition to previously supported agents

### Fixed
- **Slow pagination on large environments** — the Document API ignores the `page-size` parameter and always returns ~20 items per page; after the pagination fix in v0.18.0, this caused list commands to issue hundreds of sequential requests; resolved by defaulting `--chunk-size` to 0
- **Embedded skill files with CRLF on Windows** — added `.gitattributes` rules to force LF line endings for embedded skill files, fixing frontmatter detection failures (`"---\n"` prefix check) when building on Windows with `autocrlf=true`

## [0.18.0] - 2026-03-18

### Added
- **OpenClaw agent support** — `dtctl skills install --for openclaw` installs SKILL.md with YAML frontmatter and reference files to the OpenClaw workspace skills directory; includes auto-detection via `OPENCLAW` env var, global install support, and proper cleanup on uninstall
- **Visual output improvements** — bold table headers, status-aware coloring (green/red/yellow for known states), dimmed UUIDs, colored error prefix, dimmed empty-state message; all styling respects `NO_COLOR`, `FORCE_COLOR`, `--plain`, and TTY detection

### Changed
- **Consistent stderr messaging** — all success, warning, and info messages now use dedicated `PrintSuccess`/`PrintInfo`/`PrintWarning` helpers that write to stderr, ensuring stdout stays clean for piping and scripting; covers auth, ctx, config, alias, lookups, azure, and all create/edit/delete flows

### Fixed
- **Describe label formatting** — underscores in struct tags now render as spaces (e.g., `Display Name` instead of `Display_name`), and known acronyms (ID, UUID, SLO, URL, API, HTTP, etc.) are preserved in their uppercase form
- **Pagination page-size errors** — fixed HTTP 400 errors on paginated requests for extensions, SLOs, IAM, and document resources by not sending `page-size` together with `page-key`/`next-page-key`

## [0.15.0] - 2026-03-11

### Added
### Added
- **Live Debugger CLI workflow** (experimental -- underlying APIs and query behavior may change)
  - `dtctl update breakpoint --filters ...` for workspace filter configuration
  - `dtctl create breakpoint <file:line>` for breakpoint creation
  - `dtctl get breakpoints` with breakpoint ID in default table output
  - `dtctl describe <id|filename:line>` for breakpoint rollout/status breakdown
  - `dtctl update breakpoint <id|filename:line> --condition/--enabled`
  - `dtctl delete breakpoint <id|filename:line|--all>` with confirmation / `-y` / `--dry-run`
- **Snapshot query decoding**
  - `dtctl query ... --decode-snapshots` decodes Live Debugger snapshot payloads with simplified plain values
  - `dtctl query ... --decode-snapshots=full` preserves full decoded tree with type annotations
  - Composable with any output format (`-o json`, `-o yaml`, `-o table`, etc.)
- **TOON output format** — new `-o toon` output format using [TOON (Token-Oriented Object Notation)](https://github.com/toon-format/toon), a compact encoding optimised for LLM token efficiency; achieves ~40-60% fewer tokens vs JSON for tabular data while preserving lossless round-trip fidelity; use `-A -o toon` to enable in agent mode


### Documentation
- Added/updated Live Debugger documentation in:
  - `docs/LIVE_DEBUGGER.md`
  - `docs/QUICK_START.md`
  - `docs/dev/API_DESIGN.md`
  - `docs/dev/IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.md`
- **Generic document resource** — full lifecycle management for Dynatrace documents via `dtctl get/describe/create/edit/delete/history/restore document`; supports all document types stored in the Document API

### Changed
- **DQL query `--metadata` flag** — include response metadata (e.g. query cost, execution time) in query output; supports format-specific rendering and an optional field allow-list to restrict which metadata fields are shown

### Fixed
- **Document version field unmarshalling** — the `version` field is now correctly handled whether the API returns it as a string or an integer, preventing unmarshalling errors on certain document types

## [0.14.4] - 2026-03-10

### Changed
- **`dtctl skills install` minimal output** — installed skill files now contain only `SKILL.md` (~283 lines / ~10 KB) instead of inlining all reference documents (~1,100 lines / ~35 KB); reference docs remain embedded in the binary but are no longer concatenated into the installed file

## [0.14.3] - 2026-03-10

### Fixed
- **`dtctl doctor` false token failure** — the token check now uses the same OAuth-aware token resolution path as all other commands; previously it called `cfg.GetToken()` directly which cannot handle OAuth tokens stored in compact keyring format, causing `[FAIL] Token: cannot retrieve token "...-oauth": token not found` even when the context was fully functional

## [0.14.2] - 2026-03-10

### Added
- **Kiro Powers support** — `dtctl skills install --for kiro` installs skill files in [Kiro IDE](https://kiro.dev/)'s Powers format
  - Generates `POWER.md` with YAML frontmatter (`name`, `displayName`, `description`, `keywords`, `author`) in `.kiro/powers/dtctl/`
  - Powers activate dynamically in Kiro based on keyword matching in conversations
  - Automatic detection of Kiro via `KIRO` environment variable
  - Works with all existing skills subcommands: `install`, `uninstall`, `status`

  - Uses real production structs from `pkg/resources/*` to catch field changes automatically
  - `make test-update-golden` to update after intentional changes
  - Windows line-ending normalization for cross-platform CI

  - Added tests enforcing help text coverage (`TestAllCommandsHaveHelpText`, `TestParentVerbsHaveExamples`)
- **Agent output envelope (`--agent` / `-A`)** — Wrap all CLI output in a structured JSON envelope (`ok`, `result`, `error`, `context`) for AI agents and automation consumers
  - Auto-detects AI agent environments and enables agent mode automatically (opt out with `--no-agent`)
  - Enriched context (suggestions, pagination, warnings) for `get workflows`, `get workflow-executions`, `delete workflow`, and `apply` commands
  - Structured error output with machine-readable error codes and suggestions
- **`dtctl ctx` command** — Top-level context management shortcut (like kubectx)
